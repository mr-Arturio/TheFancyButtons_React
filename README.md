# The Fancy Buttons
___

##The Goal
The main goals of this project are:

* using a state inside components
* passing down ```props``` to child components
* manage a state from a main component that trickles down to child components

* The **counter button** will keep track how many times we click on it.
* The **angry button** will change colour to get more red until it reaches a maximum threshold.
* The **light switch button** will turn on and off when clicked.
* The **text repeater button** will copy the text of the button over and over.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
